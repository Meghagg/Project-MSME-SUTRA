## Short description

### What's the problem?

The Covid-19 pandemic has left its impact on all sectors of the economy but nowhere is the hurt as much as the Medium, Small and Micro Enterprises (MSMEs) of India. All anecdotal evidence available, such as the hundreds of thousands of stranded migrant workers across the country, suggests that MSMEs have been the worst casualty of Covid-19 induced lockdown.

### How can technology help?

Collaborations and partnerships between MSMEs and technology are the way forward for the industry to fight it out and emerge stronger amid the Coronavirus outbreak. Thus, giving birth to the idea of  “MSME SUTRA”.

### The idea

'MSME Sutra' is a way of connecting these industries with each other at national level. Enterprises registered on the portal will be given an opportunity to search for similar nature of industries along with basic contact details. These can in turn maintain a symbiotic relationship in this challenging time to keep themselves afloat. For instance, a manufacturing unit can have labor but is struggling for raw material. A similar industry has stock but due to non-availability of manpower cannot resume operation. These two can connect through our portal and initiate negotiations at their own pace. Apart from helping these enterprises in this period of turmoil, this portal would help expand customer base for these limited scaled industries.

## The architecture

![MSME SUTRA WEB PORTAL - COLLABORATE, SHARE AND GROW TOGETHER](https://github.com/Meghagg/Project-MSME-SUTRA/blob/master/Architecture-%20MSME-SUTRA.jpg)

1. The user(Vendor) navigates to Register page for registration.
2. Login with its credentials .
3. Vendor will have to navigate to services page to add any requirement for MSME UNIT's.
4. Vendors can add this information only when they will register themselves in this portal.
5. Any user who registered in the portal can see the services like raw materials  machines etc and contact the vendor.
6. Service menu will list all the services what are registered with MSME- SUTRA portal like Raw materials, machinery, human    resources and will allow the users to navigate to their corresponding pages which will further show all the listed services of the vendors with descriptive product details entered by registered vendors.
7. If a user uses MSME SUTRA to contact the vendor then they have to register themselves in the website as View contact info link is navigating the user to login page.

Our vision is to do extend our services largely by listing all the services under MSME’s, to collaborate ourselves with government officials and open a channel for multiple vendors.So that we all can fight together and support each other in the pandemic we are into right now.
