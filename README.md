## Short description

### What's the problem?

Part of the World Health Organization's guidance on limiting further spread of COVID-19 is to practice social distancing. As a result, schools in most affected areas are taking precautionary measures by closing their facilities. With school-aged children at home for an indeterminate amount of time,  keeping them engaged, entertained, and on top of their education is important.

### How can technology help?

Schools and teachers can continue to engage with their students through virtual classrooms, and even create interactive spaces for classes. As parents face a new situation where they may need to homeschool their children, finding appropriate online resources is important as well.

### The idea

It's imperative that learning and creating can continue when educational institutions have to shift the way they teach in times of crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Providing a set of open source tools, backed by IBM Cloud and Watson Services, will enable educators to more easily make content available for their students.

## The architecture

![MSME SUTRA WEB PORTAL - COLLABORATE, SHARE AND GROW TOGETHER](https://github.com/Meghagg/Project-MSME-SUTRA/blob/master/Architecture-%20MSME-SUTRA.jpg)

1. The user(Vendor) navigates to Register page for registration.
2. Login with its credentials .
3. Vendor will have to navigate to services page to add any requirement for MSME UNIT's.
4. Vendors can add this information only when they will register themselves in this portal.
5. Any user who registered in the portal can see the services like raw materials  machines etc and contact the vendor.
6. If a user uses MSME SUTRA to contact the vendor then they have to register themselves in the website as View contact info link is navigating the user to login page.

Our vision is to do extend our services largely by listing all the services under MSMEâ€™s, to collaborate ourselves with government officials and open a channel for multiple vendors.So that we all can fight together and support each other in the pandemic we are into right now.
